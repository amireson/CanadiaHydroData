# Canadian Hydrological data

This repository contains three scripts to download publicly available hydrological data form Canada. Specifically, the ECCC precipitation data, ECCC streamflow data and GIWS research data. For the GIWS data you must contact researchers in the GIWS before you use this data for anything. You are welcome to email me for this.

This repository was created for teaching purposes.
